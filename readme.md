# 🏋️ GymBoard – Gym Management MVP

GymBoard is a minimal, focused MVP application for small gyms or personal trainers who want to digitize class signups and schedules without expensive or bloated platforms.

This is **not a full SaaS platform**. It's an experimental MVP to validate whether this kind of system can be useful in a real-world gym setting.
